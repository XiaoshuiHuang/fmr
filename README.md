# Feature-metric registration
This repository is the implementation of our CVPR 2020 work: "Feature-metric Registration: A Fast Semi-supervised Approach for Robust Point Cloud Registration without Correspondences"

There are several lights of this work:

1. ðŸ’¡ This work solves the point cloud registration using feature-metric projection error. 

2. ðŸ’¡ This work can be trained with unsupervised or semi-supervised manner. 

3. ðŸ’¡ This work can handle both high noise and density variations. 

4. ðŸ’¡ This work is potential to handle cross-source point cloud registration. 


To run the code, please follow the below steps:

### 1. Install dependencies:

    pip install torch===1.5.1 torchvision===0.6.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html argparse logging numpy glob matplotlib six

### 2. Train the model

   2.1. Train on dataset ModelNet40:  
   
    python train.py -data modelnet
   
   2.2. Train on dataset 7scene:  
   
    python train.py -data 7scene
   
### 3. Evalute the model

   3.1. Evaluate on dataset ModelNet40: 
   
    python evalute.py -data modelnet
   
   3.1. Evaluate on dataset 7scene: 
   
    python evalute.py -data 7scene
 
### 4. Pre-trained models

will update soon

### 5. Code for testing your own point clouds

will update soon
